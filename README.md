# Shopping List

[WIP] This is a shopping list app built with React and Redux that I'm making for fun on my free time

todo/features:

- Favourites menu
- Edit item name
- Clear all items fea
- Sort items by name/price/quantity/category
- Make the item name input be the focused field when user enters the app

todo/bugs:

- Possible to enter empty string with X number of blank spaces as the item name

todo/styles:

- Everything. there is no style yet. for now its every feature on the same row and make sure everything works
